As a software engineer, I have been working with **Flutter** since 2019 in remote positions.

I am used to be a bug hunter in flutter, assisting others, and you can often find me on **Stack Overflow** answering Flutter-related questions.

Since mid-2025, I've taken a career break to explore and share on my YouTube channel,
**yt.yeasin50**, aiming to **learn and teach** in the era of AI.
I love open-source contributions.

If you're a **CSE student**, this channel can be beneficial.
I provide **videos and materials** on programming, mathematics, human bias,
and more, with visuals and coding examples to make learning easier
â€” even for beginners.
