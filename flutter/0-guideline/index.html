You can skip generics, Dart 3 features like records and patterns at this point. You can learn these once you are comfortable with it. A good way of learning is, solving some coding problems on different sites.\nMake sure you have removed/disabled any AI code assistance of IDE/editor. You want to learn, not be a copycat. Increase your brain muscles. Learn to think.\nCheck out the introduction: https://dart.dev/language\nUnderstanding null-safety :https://dart.dev/null-safety/understanding-null-safety\nLayout Flutter is about UI. There are golden rules:\nConstraints go down Size goes up Parent positions the children Yes, this is kinda different than other frameworks. If you understand these rules, you can tackle any layout issue, which is often shown by red or yellow boxes.\nLearn how layout works from layout/constraints.\nThis is gonna take some time but it’s worth it in the long run. Widgets Once you have a basic understanding of how layout works, you can start learning some widgets.\nBasic widgets Text Row Column Stack Container You will learn other necessary widgets to work with these widgets.\nI will suggest watching Flutter widget of the week playlist.\nWatching twice might be enough to memorize which widget is used for what. Yes, that’s all you need to memorize—just which widget provides which types of UI/features required for a working project. Take your time.\nYou can check cookbook as well. The design section will be more than enough for the time being, and you are free to skip or explore others as well.\nPart 2 There is a difference between doing things and doing them in a good way. The compiler can execute your code, but it can be difficult to read for other devs and humans.\nThis differentiates good programmers from bad ones.\nCode writing You can follow from here. Not all need to be covered, but just leaving them in case someone is interested:\nMust follow effective-dart The Clean Code by Uncle Bob The Design Patterns by Head First and GOF Design pattern YouTube playlist by Christopher Okhravi After learning a few patterns, you will start overthinking and over-engineering. Yes, mid-level programmers make things complex and write complex code by taking these different patterns as rules instead of guidance.\nThese are guidelines, not rules that must be followed in every scenario.\nKeep things simple, but don’t use others’ easy code without a certain level of understanding (of their abstraction).\nLearn by doing Yap, learn by doing stuff. We always say, fake it till you make it.\nBut just watching and doing like monkey people might not get you anywhere. Make sure you understand at a certain level.\nAnother type of developer (-/_) can be seen as a vibe coder, who don’t even bother understanding what it’s doing. The handshake between marketing and non-programmer.\nHere are a few things You can do a thing and don’t know what it is doing. You can’t do a thing but know this is supposed to be working. You can do a thing and know at a certain level what it is doing. And obviously, the last one is those who can’t do a thing and don’t even acknowledge that they don’t know — vibe coders. So know what you’re doing, at least at a certain level. Many devs add a bunch of libraries and dependencies just for simple features. This is how we easily distinguish between a good developer and a bad developer.\nI am not saying it is bad to use a package or library.
